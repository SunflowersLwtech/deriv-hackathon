# **Intelligent Trading Analyst**

## **The Challenge**

_**How might we use AI to help traders understand markets, analyse price**_
_**movements, develop sustainable trading habits, and share insights through**_
_**engaging social media content?**_

## **The Problem**


Traders face two interconnected challenges: understanding what's happening in markets and
managing their own behaviour. Professional traders have analyst teams for market insights and
coaches for discipline. Retail traders have neither.


On market understanding:

_"I see the price dropped 5% but I don't know why. By the time I find the news, the move_
_is over."_


_"There's so much information: economic calendars, news, social media, technical_
_indicators. I don't know what matters."_


_"Professional traders have Bloomberg terminals and analyst teams. I have Google and_
_hope."_


On trading behaviour:

_"I didn't realise I was on a losing streak until I'd lost half my account. No one warned_
_me."_


_"Looking back, I always trade badly when I'm trying to recover losses. I wish I'd seen that_
_pattern earlier."_


_"I know I shouldn't trade when I'm emotional, but in the moment I don't realise I'm being_
_emotional."_


On staying informed:

_"I follow trading accounts on X and LinkedIn, but they're either too basic or trying to sell_
_me something."_


_"I wish there was a trusted voice that explained what's happening in markets without the_
_hype."_


_"I'd love to share market insights with my network, but I don't have time to write quality_
_content."_


The core issue is that trading platforms provide execution but not intelligence. They don't help
traders understand what's happening in markets, recognise their own behavioural patterns, or
stay connected to a community of informed traders.

## **Why This Matters Now**


Deriv's mission is to make trading accessible to everyone. But accessibility means more than
platform access. It means having the insights to understand markets, the self-awareness to
trade sustainably, and the content to engage with the trading community.


Traders who understand markets make better decisions. Traders who recognise their
behavioural patterns avoid costly mistakes. Traders who engage with quality content stay
informed and connected.


Generative AI can now combine market analysis with behavioural insights and content creation,
providing comprehensive trading intelligence that was previously available only to professionals.

## **The Opportunity**


Build an AI-powered trading analyst that combines market intelligence, behavioural coaching,
and social content generation:


Market Analysis:

●​ Explain significant price movements in real time ("Why did EUR/USD just spike?")
●​ Identify technical patterns and explain their significance in plain language
●​ Summarise relevant news and events affecting specific instruments
●​ Provide market sentiment analysis from multiple sources
●​ Generate personalised market briefs for the instruments the trader follows


Behavioural Insights:

●​ Detect patterns indicating emotional or impulsive trading
●​ Provide gentle, timely nudges when behaviour suggests poor decision-making
●​ Help traders recognise their own winning and losing patterns
●​ Suggest breaks, limits, or reflection when appropriate
●​ Celebrate sustainable trading habits, not just profits


Social Media Personas & Content:

●​ Generate AI analyst personas that share market updates on LinkedIn and X
●​ Create platform-appropriate content: professional insights for LinkedIn, concise updates

for X
●​ Transform complex market analysis into engaging, shareable posts
●​ Produce daily/weekly market summaries, notable moves, and educational threads
●​ Maintain consistent voice and personality across personas
●​ Generate content calendars with timely, relevant market commentary


The magic is in combining all three: understanding markets, coaching traders, and creating
content that builds community and trust.

## **Questions Worth Considering**

On market analysis:


●​ What's the difference between information and actionable insight?
●​ How do you explain technical analysis without being overwhelming?
●​ How do you filter the signal from the noise in market news?
●​ What's the right latency for market analysis to still be useful?


On behavioural insights:

●​ How do you intervene without being annoying or preachy?
●​ What's the difference between a bad trade and a bad pattern?
●​ Can AI detect emotional state from trading behaviour alone?
●​ When is the right moment to suggest a break?


On social media content:

●​ What makes trading content engaging vs. boring or salesy?
●​ How do you adapt the same insight for LinkedIn vs. X?
●​ What personality should an AI analyst persona have?
●​ How do you build trust and credibility through social content?
●​ Can personas develop a following that drives platform awareness?


On combining all three:

●​ How do market conditions affect trader psychology?
●​ Can the best insights become shareable social content automatically?
●​ How do you create a cohesive experience across personal insights and public content?

## **What Would Blow Our Minds**


●​ Real-time market explanations combined with behavioural awareness


●​ An analyst who says, "The market just did X, and based on your history, you tend to Y in

these situations"
●​ AI personas that build genuine followings on LinkedIn and X
●​ A content engine that turns market analysis into viral threads
●​ Something that helps traders see both market patterns and their own patterns
●​ Social content so good that people don't realise it's AI-generated
●​ A system that catches revenge trading before it starts by connecting market moves to

behaviour
●​ Personas with distinct voices: the calm analyst, the data nerd, the trading coach


Something that makes Deriv a trusted voice in trading content
